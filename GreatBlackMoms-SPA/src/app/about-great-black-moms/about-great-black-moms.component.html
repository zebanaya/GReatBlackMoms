  <h4>About The Founders</h4>

With her current studies as a major in the Family Life Education field, she has spent over two years intently researching prenatal education and its connection to birth and family outcomes. Her combination of experience, education and passion have led to the creation of this organization with the goal of empowering and enhancing the experience of black motherhood.
